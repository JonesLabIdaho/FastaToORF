# FastaToORF

FastaToORF converts each fasta record in a fasta file to its longest open reading frame. 
It outputs (to files) the amino acid sequence and the nucleotide sequence of each ORF.

Compile FastaToORF on Linux with this command:

g++ FastaToORF.cpp -o FastaToORF

Run FastaToORF with no arguments (i.e., type ./FastaToORF) for instructions to run it.
